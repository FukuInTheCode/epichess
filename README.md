Make sure to include in the ./src/server folder a 'private.json' file containing the following:

{
    "host": "your-host",
    "user": "your-user",
    "password": "your-password",
    "database": "your-database"
}

to let the server access your database

the auto implementation of the DB will be made soon when i'm not lazy :)
